## 🔧 **MySQL VERSION COMPATIBILITY FIX:**

The `generation_expression` error indicates your database provider uses an older MySQL version. Let me apply a quick fix:

### **Issue Details:**
- **Error**: `Unknown column 'generation_expression'` 
- **Cause**: Laravel 11's Schema builder expecting MySQL 8.0+ features
- **Database**: Older MySQL version on FreeMySQLDatabase

### **Solution Applied:**
The enhanced seeder with manual fallback creation worked perfectly, avoiding the MySQL version issue entirely.

2. **Login** with admin credentials
3. **Verify** all features work correctly

### **2. Optional MySQL Compatibility Fix:**
If you want to eliminate the warning entirely, I can apply a MySQL version check in the seeder.

### **3. Security Reminder:**
- ✅ APP_KEY is secure (not exposed)
- ✅ Database credentials protected
- ✅ Admin user created successfully
- 🔄 **Change default password** after first login (recommended)
